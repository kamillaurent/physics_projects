# physics_projects
in this repository you will find some physics projects with descriptions and codes:
- in ML_hep we run a simulation of a pp collision in a particle accelerator and we use a convolutional neural network to classify quark initiated and gluon initiated jets (we use C++ for the simulation and Python for the image generation and the CNN construction)
- in particle_in_EM_field we study the motion of charged particles in electromagnetic field. We use numerical differentiation methods (Boris and RK4) to solve the motion equations in different contexts (the used programming language is C++)
